## Project Description

Use historical booking data to predict the optimal price for an AirBnB in Berlin. Our team used a [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data)
to train a predictive model on AirBnB prices and other features such as location, room type, and room properties so that users could input custom features to find an optimal price.
We trained a Multilayered Perceptron using Mean Absolute Error as an evaluation metric and had an error margin of $19.32. This tells us that overall our model will predict a price that is on average $19.32 around the actual price.
